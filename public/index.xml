      <description>Introduction This article is about how to use double pointers to solve problems such as merge array
Problem details Leetcode 88. Merge Sorted Array Analysis and thought Because it is a sorted array, add pointers at the end of nums1 and nums2 respectively. The values at the positions of the two pointers are compared each time. Copy the larger number to the last bit of nums1. After that, move the pointer.</description>

      <description>SQL experience
When combining tables, the efficiency of simply using the where statement is lower than join, which is equivalent to full join left join (left join): Returns all records including all records in the left table and records with equal join fields in the right table.
right join (right join): Returns all records including all records in the right table and records with equal join fields in the left table.</description>
